                        ConfigMgr WebService is a fork of a fork designed to extend the functionality of Operating System Deployment (OSD)
                        within System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) 2012 and above.  This project provides additional methods that 
                        interact with both SCCM and Active Directory (AD), and resolves some issues with the parent fork relating
                        to utilizing a specific domain controller for AD operations.  This project is written in C#.

                        Windows LAPS GUI is a graphical user interface (GUI) that interacts with Active Directory (AD) to retrieve the 
                        password for a managed local administrative account on domain-joined computers.  The managed account is determined
                        by settings defined in the Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) group policy object (GPO).  It is based on
                        the <a href="https://github.com/htcfreek/SimpleLapsGui" target="_">SimpleLapsGui</a> project.  This project is
